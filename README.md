# Agent Olympus

**Language / 언어:** [English](README.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md)

> Self-driving AI orchestrator plugin for Claude Code — zero dependencies, maximum autonomy.

Agent Olympus is a standalone Claude Code plugin that transforms how you build software. Give it a task, and it orchestrates specialized AI agents to complete it autonomously — analyzing requirements, planning execution, implementing changes, verifying results, and fixing issues until everything passes.

Two orchestrators, 19 specialized agents, 37 workflow skills. Zero npm dependencies.

## What It Does

Agent Olympus solves the **supervision problem**: you shouldn't have to babysit AI. Instead, you describe the goal and the orchestrator handles the complexity — planning, routing work to specialized agents, integrating results, catching failures, and looping until the task is truly complete.

Two distinct modes:

- **Atlas** — Hub-and-spoke orchestration. One orchestrator brain analyzes the task, creates a plan, spawns specialized agents in parallel, verifies results, and fixes issues autonomously. Best for independent, parallelizable work.
- **Athena** — Peer-to-peer team orchestration. Multiple agents collaborate via native SendMessage, with Codex/Gemini workers spawned through an adapter system (codex-appserver > codex-exec > tmux fallback). Best for interdependent tasks requiring real-time coordination.

Both loop until every acceptance criterion is met, the build passes, tests pass, and code review is approved — or escalate with evidence if something is unfixable.

## Features

- **Two orchestrators**: Atlas (hub-and-spoke) and Athena (peer-to-peer team)
- **19 specialized agents**: Explorer, Metis (analysis), Prometheus (planning), Momus (validation), Hermes (spec), Executor, Designer (UI/UX), **Aphrodite (design review)**, Test Engineer, Debugger, Architect, Security Reviewer, Code Reviewer, Writer (docs), Hephaestus (deep coding), Themis (quality gate), Ask, Atlas, Athena
- **37 workflow skills**: atlas, athena, ask, deep-interview, research, trace, cancel, slop-cleaner, git-master, deepinit, deep-dive, consensus-plan, external-context, verify-coverage, plan, tdd, systematic-debug, brainstorm, finish-branch, design-critique, a11y-audit, design-system-audit, ux-copy-review, ui-review, harness-init, sessions, setup-gemini-auth, **teach-design, normalize, polish, typeset, arrange, taste, ui-remediate, resume-handoff**, codex-goal, codex-review
- **Session recovery**: Checkpoint system survives interruptions; resume from any phase
- **Structured wisdom**: Cross-session learnings in JSONL format; persists across runs; intent-aware query expansion
- **Zero npm dependencies**: Node.js built-ins only
- **Multi-model support**: Claude (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) + Codex/Gemini via adapter system (appserver/exec/tmux fallback)
- **Multilingual intent detection**: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese pattern matching via IntentGate hook
- **Worker Status Dashboard**: Real-time inline markdown display of all active worker states during Athena team runs
- **Athena worktree isolation**: Each parallel worker runs in an isolated git worktree, preventing silent file overwrites between concurrent workers
- **SessionStart hook**: Automatically injects prior wisdom and interrupted checkpoint context at session start
- **Stop hook WIP commit**: Auto-saves uncommitted work as a WIP commit on session end
- **Atomic writes**: All state files use tmp+rename pattern for crash-safe writes
- **Superpowers methodology**: TDD discipline, systematic debugging, brainstorm-first gate, two-stage code review — embedded as native skills (standalone; no Superpowers install required)
- **Post-code automation** *(v0.8)*: After commit — auto-create PR, parse issue refs, watch CI, auto-fix failures, update CHANGELOG
- **Ship policy config** *(v0.8)*: `.ao/autonomy.json` controls `autoPush`, `draftPR`, `ci.maxCycles`, `notify.*`, `costAwareness`
- **OS notifications** *(v0.8)*: Desktop notifications on task complete/blocked/CI events — macOS, Linux, terminal bell fallback
- **Cost awareness** *(v0.8)*: Token cost estimate before long runs; configurable per orchestrator
- **Auto-onboarding** *(v0.8)*: Runs `deepinit` automatically if no `AGENTS.md` found
- **Visual verification** *(v0.8)*: Optional Claude Preview MCP screenshot after UI changes
- **UI/UX design review** *(v0.8.3)*: Aphrodite agent + 5 design skills — critique (Nielsen+Gestalt), a11y audit (WCAG 2.2 AA), design system audit (token leaks), UX copy review, unified UI review
- **L-scale resilience** *(v0.8.8)*: `input-guard` library prevents sub-agent silent failures on large documents — auto-summarizes oversized inputs while preserving story IDs and acceptance criteria. `preflight` library detects and clears stale pointer files in `.ao/` before each run
- **Codex permission mirroring** *(v0.9.5, reworked in v1.1.0)*: Automatically detects Claude's merged permission level (across managed/user/project scopes) and mirrors it to Codex's **sandbox axis** — broad `Bash(*)`+broad `Write(*)` → `danger-full-access`; broad Write/Edit or `acceptEdits` → `workspace-write`; scoped-only grants demote to `suggest`. Approval policy is held at `never` (codex 0.118+ is non-interactive). `.ao/autonomy.json` `codex.approval` overrides default auto-detection
- **Robust hook execution** *(v0.9.8)*: `run.sh` shell wrapper resolves node from nvm/volta/fnm/mise in restricted PATH hook environments; `run.sh || node run.cjs` fallback for Windows; `buildEnhancedPath()` injected into all capability detection child processes
- **Native Teams config fallback** *(v0.9.8)*: `.ao/autonomy.json` `nativeTeams: true` enables Native Agent Teams without `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` env var
- **Gemini permission mirroring** *(v0.9.8)*: `.ao/autonomy.json` `gemini.approval` — auto-detect or override Gemini approval mode (`yolo`, `auto_edit`, `plan`, `default`)
- **Design identity memory** *(v1.0.2)*: `.ao/memory/design-identity.json` — `/teach-design` captures brand colors, typography, spacing, component library; auto-injected into designer/aphrodite/ui-review subagents (hard 2KB cap, worktree-shared, schemaVersion:1)
- **Anti-pattern scan + precision micro-skills** *(v1.0.2, adapted from [impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable))*: `ui-smell-scan` as finish-branch gate (warn default, block opt-in), modular design reference pack (7 domains), `/normalize`, `/polish`, `/typeset`, `/arrange`, `/ui-remediate` audit→normalize→polish→re-audit convergence chain
- **Change-aware review router** *(v1.0.2, adapted from [gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack))*: CSS-only diffs minimal-route to `{aphrodite, designer}` (60-80% reviewer overhead cut) with 30+ regex security patterns that force-include `security-reviewer`; `alwaysInclude:["*"]` rollback path
- **Taste memory** *(v1.0.2, adapted from gstack)*: `.ao/memory/taste.jsonl` accumulates user aesthetic preferences across sessions; replayed to designer/aphrodite (1KB cap, 200-entry FIFO, explicit `/taste prune` grammar)
- **Browser pause + manual continue** *(v1.0.2, adapted from gstack)*: `/resume-handoff` — on CAPTCHA/auth/MFA, persists sanitized URL + breadcrumb to `.ao/state/browser-handoff.json` (16 sensitive param strip, allow-list breadcrumb, 24h TTL). Deterministic exact-resume deferred to v1.0.3.
- **Cascade artifact archival pipe** *(v1.0.2, adapted from gstack)*: `.ao/artifacts/pipe/<runId>/<stage>/{inbox,outbox}/` structured stage handoffs (6 canonical stages, 100KB/file + 10MB/run caps, atomic writes). Archival only, NOT prompt-history isolation.
- **`/ask` async path** *(v1.0.4)*: `async / status / collect / cancel / list` subcommands for long-running Codex/Gemini queries that exceed the 120s sync timeout. Job-based with detached runners, JSONL artifact streams, and a `runner_done` sentinel for crash-safe completion reconciliation
- **Plan A permission mirroring** *(v1.1.0)*: Detection reads allow/deny/ask lists from ALL Claude scopes (managed/user/project) and merges with union semantics. Broad-vs-scoped split (only literal `Tool` or `Tool(*)` promotes a tier — wildcard variants like `Bash(*:*)` map to `suggest`). Fail-closed deny/ask rules. Host-sandbox intersection (passive LSM/AppArmor/SELinux/Landlock detection) prevents privilege expansion when the Codex worker would outrun the host's actual sandbox
- **Gemini credential auto-resolver** *(v1.1.1)*: Spawns Gemini workers with `GEMINI_API_KEY` resolved from macOS Keychain or Linux libsecret at runtime — no need to export the key into your shell. Per-`(platform, service, account)` cache with split TTL (24h hit / 60s error / 30s miss). Auto-invalidates on `auth_failed` so `gemini /auth` recovery works in-session
- **Layered autonomy config** *(v1.1.2)*: `.ao/autonomy.json` resolution merges `defaults ← global ← project`, where the global layer is `AO_AUTONOMY_CONFIG` env override OR the first existing file under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agent-olympus/`, `~/.config/agent-olympus/`, or `~/.ao/`. CI kill-switch skips global layer on shared runners (CI / GITHUB_ACTIONS / etc.) unless `AO_AUTONOMY_CONFIG` is set. Symlink guard rejects global configs escaping allowed roots
- **Gemini Keychain wizard** *(v1.1.3, partition-list fix in v1.1.4)*: `/setup-gemini-auth` creates an AO-owned Keychain item with `/usr/bin/security` pre-listed as trusted, eliminating the macOS password prompt every Gemini worker spawn would otherwise trigger. Scoped to keychain users — OAuth/Vertex/env-var paths are unaffected
- **Layered Opus-skew reduction** *(v1.1.0+)*: Per-subagent model usage logging (`ao-model-usage.jsonl`, schemaVersion:1) for measurement; escalation-first routing pipeline that defaults to Sonnet/Haiku and only promotes to Opus on demonstrated need. Summarise with `node scripts/usage-report.mjs`
- **Runtime permission_mode capture + `/ask codex` read-only fallback** *(v1.1.6)*: SessionStart + UserPromptSubmit hooks read `permission_mode` from Claude Code's hook stdin (or `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` env) and persist to `.ao/state/ao-runtime-permissions.json` (schemaVersion:1, 30-min TTL). Permission detection now merges settings ⇧ runtime as **upgrade-only** through the same deny/ask/disableBypassPermissionsMode/allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly pipeline — `--dangerously-skip-permissions` no longer leaves the mirror at `suggest`. Independently, `/ask codex` on suggest-tier hosts now falls back to codex's `read-only` sandbox (`-s read-only -a never`) with a system-prompt guard + `git status --porcelain` post-check, instead of exiting with code 2. New `node scripts/diagnose-sandbox.mjs --explain-permissions` shows the full per-layer breakdown. Closes #67/#68/#69
- **Detached worker supervisor** *(v1.2.0)*: Adapter team workers (codex-exec/appserver, claude-cli, gemini-exec/acp) no longer run in-process — `spawnTeam` launches a detached supervisor per worker that owns the adapter and writes completion/failure/output to disk, so the fresh-process-per-poll orchestrator (`monitorTeam`/`collectResults`/`shutdownTeam`) finally observes their outcome across the process boundary (they were previously stuck `running` forever). Run-scoped snapshots (schemaVersion:1) with PID start-time identity for crash/reuse detection, supervisor-first shutdown with orphan-group reap, per-run SessionEnd protection, and prompt-bearing-manifest scrubbing. Shipped across P1–P6 phases with 4 Codex cross-review rounds
- **2376 unit tests**: Comprehensive test suite using `node:test` across 92 test files (v1.4.0: 2376/2376 passing)
- **Fail-safe architecture**: Hooks never block Claude Code; graceful degradation on errors

## Installation

### Via Marketplace (Recommended)

1. Open Claude Code
2. Go to **Marketplace** → **Productivity**
3. Find **Agent Olympus** by Karnian
4. Click **Install**

### Manual Install

Clone the repository and reference it in your Claude Code plugin directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karnian/agent-olympus.git ~/.claude/plugins/agent-olympus
```

## Quick Start

### Atlas (Hub-and-Spoke)

Start an autonomous task:

```
/atlas build a user authentication system with login and signup
```

Or describe your task in any language — IntentGate detects intent across English, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese:

```
아틀라스 사용자 로그인 시스템을 구현해줘
/atlas rebuild the payment processing pipeline
```

Atlas will:

1. **Triage** the task (trivial vs. complex)
2. **Analyze** affected files and dependencies
3. **Plan** a structured work breakdown with acceptance criteria
4. **Validate** the plan (catches blocking issues early)
5. **Execute** in parallel using specialized agents
6. **Verify** build, tests, linting
7. **Review** architecture, security, code quality
8. **Loop** on failures — debug and retry until everything passes

### Athena (Peer-to-Peer Team)

Spawn a coordinated team:

```
/athena build an API with frontend, tests, and documentation
```

Athena will:

1. **Design** a team of Claude workers + Codex workers
2. **Plan** task assignments and handoff points
3. **Spawn** workers simultaneously
4. **Monitor** and bridge Claude↔Codex communication
5. **Integrate** results
6. **Verify** and review
7. **Loop** until all workers' outputs are tested and approved

### Resume Interrupted Work

If a session is interrupted:

```
/atlas [previous task]
```

Atlas detects the checkpoint and offers to resume:

```
[Previous session found: Phase 3/EXECUTE. Completed: 2/5 stories.
Resume from Phase 3 or restart?]
```

Reply `resume` to pick up where you left off.

### Post-Code Automation (New in v0.8.0)

After `/atlas` or `/athena` completes and commits, the SHIP phase runs automatically:

1. Reads `.ao/autonomy.json` for ship policy (`autoPush`, `draftPR`, `ci.maxCycles`)
2. Pushes branch and creates PR (with parsed issue refs from branch/commits)
3. Monitors CI via `gh run list` until pass or fail
4. On CI failure: fetches failed logs → spawns debugger → fixes → pushes → re-polls (max 3 cycles)
5. Sends desktop notification on completion or block

Configure by creating `.ao/autonomy.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "autoPush": true,
  "draftPR": false,
  "ci": { "maxCycles": 3, "pollIntervalMs": 10000 },
  "notify": { "onDone": true, "onBlocked": true, "onCIFail": true },
  "costAwareness": true,
  "progressBriefing": true
}
```

- **`/design-critique`** — Structured design feedback using Nielsen 10 heuristics + Gestalt principles + WCAG standards
- **`/a11y-audit`** — WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility audit via code review only — no browser tools needed
- **`/design-system-audit`** — Audit for token leaks (hardcoded colors, spacing), component API consistency, missing states
- **`/ux-copy-review`** — Review error messages, CTAs, empty states, labels for clarity, consistency, and tone

## Orchestrators

### Atlas: Hub-and-Spoke

**When to use:**
- Task has independent, parallelizable components
- You want one orchestrator brain making all routing decisions
- Standard implementation, testing, review workflows

**Architecture:**

```
User Request
    ↓
[Triage] → Trivial? → Execute directly
    ↓ Moderate+
[Analyze] (Metis: deep requirements, risks, unknowns)
    ↓
[Plan] (Prometheus: structured work breakdown)
    ↓
[Validate] (Momus: catches blocking issues)
    ↓
[Execute] (Parallel agents: executor, designer, test-engineer, debugger, etc.)
    ↓
[Verify] (Build + tests + lint)
    ↓ Failures?
[Debug] (Debugger agent fixes issues, loops back)
    ↓
[Review] (Architect + Security + Code Quality reviewers)
    ↓ Rejections?
[Fix & Re-review] (Loops until approved)
    ↓
[Done] (Cleanup, wisdom saved)
```

**Phases:**

1. **Triage** — Classify complexity, decide strategy
2. **Analyze** — Requirements, risks, dependencies
3. **Plan + Validate** — Work breakdown with acceptance criteria
4. **Execute** — Parallel agent work
5. **Verify** — Build, tests, lint
6. **Review** — Architecture, security, code quality
7. **Slop Clean + Commit** — Cleanup and atomic commits

### Athena: Peer-to-Peer Team

**When to use:**
- Task has interdependent parts (API + frontend need coordination)
- Workers need to share discoveries in real-time
- Large-scale work across many files and multiple specialties

**Architecture:**

```
[Athena Lead] ← Orchestrator (NEVER implements, only coordinates)
    ↓
    ├─→ Claude Native Team (SendMessage, TaskList)
    │   ├─ API Worker (executor)
    │   ├─ Frontend Worker (designer)
    │   ├─ Test Worker (test-engineer)
    │   └─ Docs Worker (writer)
    │
    └─→ Codex/Gemini Workers (via adapter system)
        ├─ Algorithm Worker
        └─ Refactoring Worker
```

**Phases:**

1. **Triage & Team Design** — Map task into independent scopes
2. **Plan** — Task assignments, dependencies, handoff protocol
3. **Spawn Team** — Launch all workers simultaneously
4. **Monitor & Coordinate** — Bridge communication, unblock workers
5. **Integrate & Verify** — Merge outputs, run build + tests
6. **Review** — All reviewers, fix rejections
7. **Slop Clean + Commit** — Final cleanup and commits

**Key Difference from Atlas:**

| Aspect | Atlas | Athena |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Communication | Hub-and-spoke (lead controls all) | Peer-to-peer (workers talk to each other) |
| Discovery sharing | Lead relays insights | Workers share discoveries directly |
| Best for | Independent tasks | Interdependent tasks |
| Overhead | Lower | Higher but more collaborative |

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
agents/              Agent persona definitions (.md files with model + role)
skills/              User-facing workflow skills (SKILL.md with triggers, steps)
scripts/             Hook scripts (Node.js ESM, zero dependencies)
  lib/               Shared libraries (stdin, intent, tmux, wisdom, checkpoint)
  run.cjs            Universal hook entry point with version fallback
config/              Model routing configuration (JSONC)
hooks/               Hook event registrations (hooks.json)
.claude-plugin/      Plugin metadata (plugin.json, marketplace.json)
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Fail-Safe Hooks**: Every hook catches errors and outputs JSON, never throws
2. **State Isolation**: Per-orchestrator checkpoint, transient state files in `.ao/state/`
3. **Wisdom Persistence**: Cross-session learnings in `.ao/wisdom.jsonl` (JSONL format)
4. **Checkpoint Recovery**: 24-hour TTL; resume from any phase after interruption
5. **Zero Dependencies**: Node.js ≥ 20.0 only; no npm packages at runtime

### Session State Management

**Checkpoints** (`.ao/state/checkpoint-<orchestrator>.json`):
- Saved after each phase transition
- Contains: orchestrator, phase, prdSnapshot, completedStories, activeWorkers, taskDescription
- TTL: 24 hours (auto-cleared if stale)
- Purpose: Resume interrupted sessions

**PRD** (`.ao/prd.json`):
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Story status: `passes: true/false`
- Story assignment: `assignTo`, `model`, `parallelGroup`
- Purpose: Track execution progress against requirements

**Wisdom** (`.ao/wisdom.jsonl`):
- JSONL format (one entry per line)
- Categories: test, build, architecture, pattern, debug, performance, general
- Entries survive across sessions (never auto-delete)
- Automatically pruned to 200 most recent entries after completion
- Purpose: Cross-session learnings reduce friction in future runs

**Teams** (`.ao/teams/<slug>/`) — Athena only:
- Per-worker communication directories for Codex/Gemini (adapter-managed)
- Cleaned up after team completion

## Session Recovery

If Claude Code crashes or closes during an orchestration:

1. Run `/atlas [previous task]` or `/athena [previous task]`
2. Orchestrator detects stale checkpoint (< 24h old)
3. Presents options: **Resume** or **Restart**
   - **Resume** → Skip completed phases, restore story state, continue from where you left off
   - **Restart** → Clear checkpoint, start fresh

This works because checkpoints are saved after each phase transition and store PRD snapshots.

## Wisdom System

Agent Olympus learns from every execution. After each story, agents contribute learnings:

```javascript
addWisdom({
  category: 'pattern',
  lesson: 'Codebase uses snake_case for API response keys',
  confidence: 'high'
})

addWisdom({
  category: 'debug',
  lesson: 'TypeScript strict mode requires explicit return types on async functions',
  confidence: 'high'
})
```

**Categories:**
- `test` — Test framework quirks, patterns that work
- `build` — Build tool behavior, compilation requirements
- `architecture` — Structural decisions, module boundaries
- `pattern` — Codebase conventions, naming, error handling
- `debug` — Pitfalls, root causes, antipatterns
- `performance` — Optimization findings
- `general` — Everything else

**Persistence:**
- Stored in `.ao/wisdom.jsonl` (JSONL format)
- Survives across sessions indefinitely
- Automatically pruned to 200 most recent entries + auto-cleanup of entries older than 90 days
- Never auto-deleted (you choose when to clear)

Later sessions query wisdom to accelerate analysis, avoid repeating mistakes, and leverage codebase knowledge.

## Multi-Model Support

### Claude Models

- **Haiku** — Fast exploratory tasks (codebase scans, documentation)
- **Sonnet** — Standard implementation (most executor, designer, test work)
- **Opus** — Complex reasoning (analysis, planning, architecture, security review)

### Codex / Gemini (via Adapter System)

For algorithmic work, large refactoring, or exploratory coding, orchestrators spawn Codex/Gemini workers through a strategy-pattern adapter system. The adapter is auto-selected by priority:

| Worker Type | Priority |
|-------------|----------|
| **Codex** | codex-appserver (JSON-RPC 2.0) → codex-exec (JSONL) → tmux (legacy fallback) |
| **Gemini** | gemini-acp (JSON-RPC 2.0) → gemini-exec (JSON) → tmux (legacy fallback) |
| **Claude** | claude-cli (stream-json) → tmux (legacy fallback) |

The permission level is automatically resolved from Claude's permission level (see [Permission Mirroring](#features)). Override via `.ao/autonomy.json` `codex.approval` or `gemini.approval`.

Session naming convention:
- Atlas: `atlas-codex-<N>`, `atlas-gemini-<N>`
- Athena: `athena-<slug>-codex-<N>`, `athena-<slug>-gemini-<N>`

## Requirements

- **Node.js** ≥ 20.0.0 (for ESM support)
- **Optional**: tmux (legacy fallback for all worker types when native adapters are unavailable)
- **Optional**: codex CLI (`npm install -g @openai/codex`) for Codex worker execution
- **Optional**: gemini CLI (`npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`) for Gemini worker execution
- **npm packages**: None (zero runtime dependencies)

## Project Structure for Contributors

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create `agents/<name>.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
model: sonnet  # haiku | sonnet | opus
description: One-line description
---
```

2. Write the persona prompt below the frontmatter
3. Reference it in skills/SKILL.md as `agent-olympus:<name>`

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: <name>
description: One-line description (include key trigger keywords for discoverability)
---
```

2. Write workflow steps
3. Reference agents via `Task(subagent_type="agent-olympus:<agent>", model="<tier>", prompt="...")`

### Adding a New Hook

1. Create `scripts/<hook-name>.mjs` following the fail-safe pattern:

```javascript
import { readStdin } from './lib/stdin.mjs';
async function main() {
  try {
    const raw = await readStdin(3000);
    const data = JSON.parse(raw);
    // ... hook logic ...
    process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ /* output */ }));
  } catch {
    process.stdout.write('{}');
  }
  process.exit(0);
}
main();
```

2. Register in `hooks/hooks.json` under the appropriate event
3. Use `run.cjs` as the command wrapper for version-safe resolution

### Syntax Checking

Verify all scripts are valid:

```bash
for f in scripts/*.mjs scripts/lib/*.mjs; do node --check "$f" && echo "OK: $f"; done
```

Check for stale namespace references:

```bash
grep -r "oh-my-claude:" agents/ skills/ scripts/ config/
grep -r "oh-my-claudecode:" skills/ agents/
grep -r '\.omc/' scripts/ skills/ agents/
```

## Testing Notes

A `node:test` based test suite (2376 tests across 92 files as of v1.4.0) covers the core hook libraries. To run:

```bash
node --test 'scripts/test/**/*.test.mjs'
# or
npm test
```

Additional integration verification:

1. Syntax check all scripts (see above)
2. Run a trivial `/atlas` task in Claude Code
3. Run an `/athena` task to verify team orchestration
4. Check `.ao/wisdom.jsonl` is populated after completion
5. Verify checkpoints can be resumed after interruption

## Philosophy

Agent Olympus embodies three core principles:

1. **Autonomy**: You describe the goal; the orchestrator handles the details. No babysitting.
2. **Verification**: Loops until every criterion is met. Failures are fixed, not ignored.
3. **Learning**: Wisdom persists across sessions. Each run makes the next run faster.

The name is deliberate. Atlas carries the world. Athena leads the team. Together, they complete any task you ask.
