# CLAUDE.md — Agent Olympus

This file provides guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What This Project Is

Agent Olympus is a standalone Claude Code plugin that provides two self-driving AI orchestrators:
- **Atlas** — sub-agent based (hub-and-spoke): one brain delegates to many specialized agents
- **Athena** — team based (peer-to-peer): multiple agents collaborate via SendMessage + Codex/Gemini workers

Both orchestrators autonomously loop until the task is fully complete (build passes, tests pass, reviews approved).

## Key Conventions

### Naming
- **Agents**: Greek mythology names (atlas, athena, metis, prometheus, momus, hermes, hephaestus, themis, aphrodite); also role-based agents (test-engineer, code-reviewer, etc.)
- **Namespace**: `agent-olympus:` prefix for all subagent_type references
- **State files**: `.ao/state/` directory with `ao-` prefix per hook

### Code Style (scripts/)
- All scripts are ESM (.mjs), except `run.cjs` (CJS for cross-platform compatibility)
- Zero npm dependencies — Node.js built-ins only
- Every hook must be **fail-safe**: `catch → process.stdout.write('{}') → process.exit(0)`
- Output via `process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(...))`, not `console.log`
- File permissions: `mode: 0o600` for state files, `mode: 0o700` for state directories

### Hook Architecture
- `run.cjs` is the universal entry point — it resolves the correct script path with version fallback
- All hooks receive JSON on stdin and output JSON on stdout
- Hooks must complete within their timeout (3s for most, 5s for SessionStart/SessionEnd, 10s for Stop)
- Hooks never block Claude Code — they fail open on any error
- Hooks can set `"async": true` to run in the background without blocking Claude's execution
- **IntentGate** (`scripts/intent-gate.mjs`) — fires on UserPromptSubmit; classifies intent via pattern matching and saves routing context to `.ao/state/ao-intent.json` for downstream model routing. Categories: `visual-engineering`, `design-review`, `deep`, `quick`, `writing`, `artistry`, `planning`, `external-model`. The `external-model` category detects requests to query Codex/Gemini (e.g. "ask codex", "코덱스한테 물어봐", "cross-review") and injects capability-aware advice to use the `/ask` skill
- **ModelRouter** (`scripts/model-router.mjs`) — fires on PreToolUse Task/Agent; reads intent state from IntentGate and injects model routing advice as `additionalContext` (advisory only, never blocks)
- **SessionStart** (`scripts/session-start.mjs`) — fires at session start; injects prior wisdom and any interrupted checkpoint context into the conversation
- **SubagentStart** (`scripts/subagent-start.mjs`) — fires when a subagent is spawned; injects token efficiency directive (non-haiku agents only) + wisdom context via `additionalContext`, filtered by `subagent_type` relevance
- **Notification** (`scripts/notification.mjs`) — fires on `idle_prompt` and `permission_prompt` events; logs to `.ao/state/ao-notifications.json` for stall detection (async, non-blocking)
- **SubagentStop** (`scripts/subagent-stop.mjs`) — fires when a subagent completes; captures results to `.ao/state/ao-subagent-results.json` (async, non-blocking); also triggers concurrency-release as safety net
- **ConcurrencyGate** (`scripts/concurrency-gate.mjs`) — fires on PreToolUse Task/Agent; enforces parallel limits (global 10, claude 8, codex 5, gemini 5) with 3-min stale pruning. Limits configurable via `config/model-routing.jsonc` or `AO_CONCURRENCY_*` env vars
- **ConcurrencyRelease** (`scripts/concurrency-release.mjs`) — fires on PostToolUse Task/Agent + SubagentStop; 3-stage release: task_id match → provider match → SubagentStop safety net (force-release oldest). Stale threshold 3 min
- **PlanExecuteGate** (`scripts/plan-execute-gate.mjs`) — fires on PostToolUse ExitPlanMode; reads `planExecution` from autonomy.json and injects execution routing (solo/ask/atlas/athena); `ask` mode instructs Claude to use `AskUserQuestion` interactive UI with text fallback; writes marker `.ao/state/ao-plan-pending.json` for SessionStart fallback (marker preserved as `handled: true`, cleaned by SessionEnd after 24h)
- **SessionEnd** (`scripts/session-end.mjs`) — fires on session termination; cleans up stale state files older than 24h (async, non-blocking)
- **Stop** (`scripts/stop-hook.mjs`) — fires at session end; auto-commits any uncommitted work as a WIP commit so nothing is lost; uses selective staging (excludes `.env`, secrets, `.ao/state/`, `.ao/teams/`)

### Skill vs Agent
- **Skill** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) = workflow recipe with steps. User-facing, triggered by `/command` or keyword matching
- **Agent** (`agents/*.md`) = role persona with model assignment. Called internally via `Task(subagent_type="agent-olympus:<name>")`
- Not every agent has a matching skill. executor, debugger, designer etc. are internal-only
- **Available agents** (agents/): aphrodite, ask, atlas, athena, architect, code-reviewer, debugger, designer, executor, explore, hephaestus, hermes, metis, momus, prometheus, security-reviewer, test-engineer, themis, writer
- **Available skills** (skills/): a11y-audit, arrange, ask, athena, atlas, brainstorm, cancel, consensus-plan, deep-dive, deep-interview, deepinit, design-critique, design-system-audit, external-context, finish-branch, git-master, harness-init, normalize, plan, polish, research, resume-handoff, sessions, slop-cleaner, systematic-debug, taste, tdd, teach-design, trace, typeset, ui-remediate, ui-review, ux-copy-review, verify-coverage

### State Management
- `.ao/prd.json` — PRD with user stories and acceptance criteria (ephemeral working copy)
- `.ao/spec.md` — human-readable spec (ephemeral working copy)
- `.ao/wisdom.jsonl` — structured cross-iteration learnings in JSONL format (NEVER delete, survives /cancel)
- `.ao/progress.txt` — legacy format, auto-migrated to wisdom.jsonl on first run
- `.ao/memory/` — **[v1.0.2+] durable long-lived memory namespace; EXEMPT from SessionEnd 24h cleanup; shared across all worktrees via git-common-dir resolution**
  - `.ao/memory/design-identity.json` — brand colors, typography tokens, spacing scale, component library (schemaVersion: 1); populated by `/teach-design`
  - `.ao/memory/taste.jsonl` — aesthetic preference accumulation (schemaVersion: 1 per line); populated by `/taste`; capped at 200 entries (FIFO)
  - Loader rule: any file with `schemaVersion > 1` is refused and the loader returns the empty default (fail-safe forward-compat)
  - Opt-out: `autonomy.json { memory: { disabled: true } }` causes all memory loaders to return empty defaults without touching disk
- `.ao/state/checkpoint-{atlas|athena}.json` — session recovery checkpoints (auto-expire 24h); emits events to active run on save/clear
- `.ao/state/ao-active-run-{atlas|athena}.json` — active run identity pointer (links checkpoint ↔ run-artifacts)
- `.ao/state/ao-subagent-results.json` — captured subagent outputs (capped at 50, FIFO); also emits `subagent_completed` events to active run
- `.ao/state/ao-current-session.json` — active session pointer (sessionId + startedAt); used for crash recovery
- `.ao/state/ao-capabilities.json` — cached capability detection results (60-min TTL, file-based since hooks run as separate processes). To force refresh after installing codex/gemini mid-session, delete this file manually
- `.ao/state/ao-notifications.json` — logged idle/permission prompt notifications for stall detection (capped at 50 entries, FIFO)
- `.ao/state/ao-plan-pending.json` — marker for plan execution routing fallback (created by PlanExecuteGate, consumed by SessionStart)
- `.ao/state/browser-handoff.json` — [v1.0.2+] browser pause state (sessionId + sanitized URL + sanitized breadcrumb); 24h TTL; created by US-006 browser-handoff.mjs; read by `/resume-handoff`
- `.ao/state/ask-jobs/<jobId>.json` — [v1.0.4+] per-job metadata for the async `/ask` path (schemaVersion:1). **Single-writer rule:** only the detached `_run-job` runner process ever writes this file; `status`/`collect`/`cancel`/`list` subcommands are read-only. 24h SessionEnd sweep applies.
- `.ao/state/ask-jobs/<jobId>.prompt` — [v1.0.4+] raw prompt sidecar for async `/ask` jobs; written by the async launcher and deleted by the runner on adapter spawn (mode 0o600).
- `.ao/state/*.json` — transient state files (deleted on completion or cleaned by SessionEnd after 24h)
- `.ao/sessions/<sessionId>.json` — per-session metadata (branch, cwd, status, linked runIds); shared across worktrees; 90-day TTL
- `.ao/artifacts/runs/<runId>/` — per-run artifacts (events.jsonl, summary.json, verification.jsonl)
  - `.ao/artifacts/runs/<runId>/ui-remediation.json` — [v1.0.2+] sequential remediation chain results (schemaVersion: 1); written by `/ui-remediate`
- `.ao/artifacts/ask/<jobId>.jsonl` — [v1.0.4+] raw JSONL event stream (adapter stdout tee) for async `/ask` jobs. Also carries the runner-written `{"type":"runner_done","schemaVersion":1,"status":"completed|failed|cancelled","text":...}` sentinel — the adapter-agnostic completion oracle used by `status`/`collect` reconciliation when the runner crashed before flipping metadata.
- `.ao/artifacts/ask/<jobId>.md` — [v1.0.4+] rendered markdown body for async `/ask` jobs, synthesized by the runner from `handle._output` on the completed path. JobId-addressable (vs sync path's `<model>-<ts>.md`) to tolerate parallel launches.
- `.ao/artifacts/pipe/` — **[v1.0.2+] cascade artifact ARCHIVAL pipe (NOT prompt-history isolation); swept by SessionEnd after 24h**
  - `.ao/artifacts/pipe/<runId>/<stage>/outbox/` — stage output archives written by orchestrators
  - `.ao/artifacts/pipe/<runId>/<stage>/inbox/` — prior-stage handoff manifests for current stage
  - Canonical stage names: `plan`, `decompose`, `execute`, `verify`, `review`, `finish` (schema-validated; free-form names rejected)
  - Per-file cap: 100KB (tail-truncation warning on exceed); per-run cap: 10MB (drops + warning on exceed)
  - ARCHIVAL ONLY: continuous-session orchestrators cannot deliver strict prompt-history isolation; isolation requires fresh-process stage runners (out of scope v1.0.2, per spec.md N12)
- `.ao/teams/` — tmux worker inbox/outbox directories (Athena only)
- `.ao/worktrees/<teamSlug>/<workerName>/` — isolated git worktrees for Athena parallel workers (Athena only; cleaned up after team completion)
- `docs/plans/` — git-tracked permanent plan storage (survives sessions, shared with team)
- `docs/plans/README.md` — auto-generated index of all plans
- `docs/plans/<slug>/CHANGELOG.md` — per-plan change history

### schemaVersion Convention (v1.0.2+)

Every new persisted file format introduced in v1.0.2 carries `schemaVersion: 1`:
- **JSON files**: top-level field (`{ "schemaVersion": 1, ... }`)
- **JSONL files**: per-line field (`{"schemaVersion":1,"id":"..."}`)
- **Loader rule**: if `schemaVersion > 1` (unknown future format), the loader MUST return the empty default (`{}` or `[]`) and emit a clear error to stderr (suppressOutput). Never throw or block.
- **Writer rule**: callers are responsible for including `schemaVersion: 1` in data passed to memory.mjs writers and artifact writers.
- **Migration policy**: when schemaVersion increments in a future release, the new loader MUST include a migration path or a clear upgrade message.

## How to Add a New Agent

1. Create `agents/<name>.md` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   model: sonnet  # haiku | sonnet | opus
   description: One-line description
   ---
   ```
2. Write the persona prompt below the frontmatter
3. Reference it in skills as `agent-olympus:<name>`

## How to Add a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: <name>
   description: One-line description (include key trigger keywords for discoverability)
   ---
   ```
2. Write the workflow steps
3. Reference agents via `Task(subagent_type="agent-olympus:<agent>", model="<tier>", prompt="...")`

## How to Add a New Hook

1. Create `scripts/<hook-name>.mjs` following the fail-safe pattern:
   ```javascript
   import { readStdin } from './lib/stdin.mjs';
   async function main() {
     try {
       const raw = await readStdin(3000);
       const data = JSON.parse(raw);
       // ... hook logic ...
       process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ /* output */ }));
     } catch {
       process.stdout.write('{}');
     }
     process.exit(0);
   }
   main();
   ```
2. Register in `hooks/hooks.json` under the appropriate event
3. Use `run.cjs` as the command wrapper for version-safe resolution

## Worker Adapter System

Workers (Codex, Claude, and Gemini) are spawned via a strategy-pattern adapter system (`selectAdapter()`):

### Adapter Priority (highest → lowest)

**Codex workers** (`type: 'codex'`):
1. **codex-appserver** — Multi-turn JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (`codex app-server`)
   - Thread/turn lifecycle, live steering via `steerTurn()`, structured errors
   - Requires `hasCodexAppServer` capability (codex ≥ 0.116.0 + app-server subcommand)
2. **codex-exec** — Single-turn JSONL via `child_process.spawn` (`codex exec --json`)
   - 5 event types, error classification, SIGTERM→SIGKILL shutdown
   - Requires `hasCodexExecJson` capability (codex ≥ 0.116.0)

**Claude workers** (`type: 'claude'`):
3. **claude-cli** — Headless Claude Code via `claude -p --output-format stream-json`
   - Stream-json JSONL (system/assistant/result events), budget control, model override
   - Binary auto-discovered from versioned install paths (macOS/Linux)
   - Requires `hasClaudeCli` capability

**Gemini workers** (`type: 'gemini'`):
4. **gemini-acp** — Multi-turn JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (`gemini --acp`)
   - ACP (Agent Communication Protocol): newSession/prompt/cancel/setSessionMode lifecycle
   - camelCase method names (sessionStarted, promptCompleted, etc.)
   - Message queue for team communication: `enqueueMessage()` → auto-drain on turn completion
   - No mid-turn injection (unlike Codex `steerTurn()`) — messages queued between turns
   - Requires `hasGeminiAcp` capability (gemini CLI with `--acp` flag support)
5. **gemini-exec** — Single-turn JSON via `child_process.spawn` (`gemini --output-format json -p`)
   - Single JSON object output, error classification, SIGTERM→SIGKILL shutdown
   - Requires `hasGeminiCli` capability

**All workers**:
6. **tmux** — Legacy fallback, works for all worker types
   - `tmux new-session` + `tmux send-keys` + `tmux capture-pane`
   - Always available when tmux is installed

### Permission Mirroring

All worker types (Codex, Claude, Gemini) mirror the host session's permission level via `scripts/lib/permission-detect.mjs`. This shared module eliminates duplication between adapter-specific approval modules.

**Detection (Plan A, 2026-04-14)** reads allow/deny/ask lists from ALL documented Claude scopes and MERGES them (union semantics, per Claude docs):

- Precedence order (highest first): **managed** (`/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-settings.json` on macOS, `/etc/claude-code/` on Linux, `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` on Windows, plus lexically-ordered `managed-settings.d/*.json` fragments) → **project-local** `.claude/settings.local.json` → **project** `.claude/settings.json` → **user-local** `~/.claude/settings.local.json` → **user** `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- `allow` / `deny` / `ask` lists UNION across all scopes (a user-level `Bash(*)` merges with a project-level `Write(*)`).
- `defaultMode` is taken from the HIGHEST precedence scope that sets it.
- `disableBypassPermissionsMode: true` in ANY scope (OR semantics) demotes `bypassPermissions` to no-implicit-grant.

**Broad vs scoped split** — only LITERAL `Tool` or `Tool(*)` in `allow` count as "broad". Wildcard variants like `Bash(*:*)`, `Bash(**)`, `Bash(*,*)` are SCOPED (per Claude's matcher, `:*` is a trailing-wildcard suffix, not universal). **Only broad grants promote a tier** — scoped grants alone map to `suggest`, because codex's coarse sandbox tiers cannot honor the user's scoped restriction:
- `Write(src/**)` alone → `suggest`. `workspace-write` would let codex edit `docs/**` too (privilege expansion).
- `Bash(git:*)` alone → `suggest`. `workspace-write` still allows arbitrary shell in cwd (`rm`, `curl`, etc.) — not just git.

**Managed policy** — managed settings come from OS-specific locations (macOS `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/`, Linux `/etc/claude-code/`, Windows `C:\Program Files\ClaudeCode\` with `%PROGRAMDATA%\ClaudeCode\` as legacy fallback). Each root supports a `managed-settings.json` plus a lexically-ordered `managed-settings.d/*.json` fragment dir. Within managed scope, **fragments override earlier scalars** (last-wins) for `defaultMode` and similar scalar fields. `permissions.allowManagedPermissionRulesOnly: true` in managed suppresses non-managed `allow` lists, but deny/ask from ALL scopes still apply (defense-in-depth). `disableBypassPermissionsMode` accepts both legacy boolean `true` and current string `"disable"`.

**Fail-closed rules** (codex is non-interactive, cannot honor "please confirm"):
- Any `Bash(...)` or `Bash` entry in `ask` — even scoped — invalidates the broad Bash grant.
- Literal broad deny (`Bash(*)` or `Bash`) removes ALL Bash grants (broad + scoped).
- Any scoped deny (`Bash(curl:*)`) invalidates the broad Bash grant (scoped restriction cannot be honored under `danger-full-access`).

**defaultMode as implicit grant** — `bypassPermissions` (unless disabled) is an implicit broad allow for ALL tools; `acceptEdits` is an implicit broad allow for Write+Edit only. Both flow through the SAME deny/ask fail-closed pipeline, so `bypassPermissions + deny Bash(*)` correctly demotes Bash while keeping Write/Edit broad.

**Codex** mirrors permissions to the **sandbox axis** (not the approval axis). Both `codex-exec` and `codex-appserver` workers run non-interactively — there is no TTY to prompt for approvals — so we hold the approval policy at `never` and vary the Codex sandbox tier instead. (Codex 0.118+ docs: *"Prefer `on-request` for interactive runs or `never` for non-interactive runs"*; the `--auto-edit` flag was removed in 0.118.)

| Merged Claude permissions                                          | `-a` (approval) | `-s` (sandbox)       |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Broad `Bash(*)` + broad `Write(*)`, no ask/deny interference       | `never`         | `danger-full-access` |
| Any broad/scoped Write/Edit, or scoped Bash, or `acceptEdits` mode | `never`         | `workspace-write`    |
| Otherwise (suggest-tier)                                           | _demoted_       | _demoted_            |

Suggest-tier hosts cannot run codex usefully — a `read-only` sandbox would let codex silently complete with "I can only suggest changes" and confuse Atlas/Athena into marking the task done. So:
- **Atlas/Athena teams** (`worker-spawn.mjs`): codex workers are demoted to `claude` workers BEFORE adapter selection (`demoteCodexWorkersIfNeeded`). The `_demotedFrom`/`_demotionReason`/`_demotedModel` fields are preserved on the worker for observability. Provider-specific fields like `model` are stripped so the Claude path doesn't receive a Codex model name.
- **`/ask` skill** (`ask.mjs`): codex requests exit with code 2 (model not available, answer as Claude) — no team context to demote into.

The `-a` and `-s` flags are GLOBAL Codex CLI flags and MUST appear BEFORE the `exec` subcommand. `codex exec -a never` errors with `unexpected argument '-a'` in 0.118+.

**Known limitation — settings-file mirror, not live session mirror.** Detection reads Claude Code's *settings files* only; it does NOT observe runtime session state. That means `--permission-mode`, `--allowedTools`, `--disallowedTools` CLI launch flags and mid-session mode flips (e.g. Shift+Tab) are invisible. If the host session's actual permissions are narrower than the on-disk settings, the worker may be mirrored to a broader tier. Workers still run under codex's sandbox (workspace-write at most) so damage is capped, but set `.ao/autonomy.json { codex: { approval: "suggest" } }` or explicit CLI flags if you need a strict ceiling.

**Host sandbox intersection** (`scripts/lib/host-sandbox-detect.mjs`). The codex permission level derived from `permissions.allow` is now INTERSECTED with a passive host-sandbox detection (the more restrictive of the two wins). Signal priority:

1. **Explicit override** (ground truth) — `AO_HOST_SANDBOX_LEVEL` env var OR `.ao/autonomy.json { codex: { hostSandbox: ... } }` ∈ `{unrestricted, workspace-write, read-only}`. Env wins when both are set.
2. **Linux LSM enforcing** — AppArmor (`/proc/self/attr/current` `(enforce)`), SELinux (`/sys/fs/selinux/enforce == 1` + non-`unconfined_t` context), or Landlock (`/proc/self/status` Landlock field). Any of these → tier `workspace-write`.
3. **Otherwise** — tier `unknown` (NO silent downgrade; ambiguous signals like containers, seccomp, or macOS `OPERON_SANDBOXED_NETWORK` are recorded as SIGNALS but don't force a tier change).

When tier is `unknown` but filesystem-scoped signals exist (containerized, seccomp filter, NoNewPrivs), Atlas/Athena records a one-time `architecture` wisdom warning asking the user to set `AO_HOST_SANDBOX_LEVEL` explicitly. Network-only signals (OPERON_SANDBOXED_NETWORK) do NOT trigger the warning because the override controls filesystem tier, not network.

Diagnostic CLI: `node scripts/diagnose-sandbox.mjs` prints the full detection record (tier, source, all signals, effective codex level) as JSON. Use it to figure out whether you need to set an explicit override.

**Known limitation.** Host sandbox detection is passive only — no active probing of writable roots or network reachability. A host that appears unrestricted on paper but is actually inside a chroot or `sandbox-exec` policy without exposing LSM-equivalent signals will still show tier `unknown`. Set `AO_HOST_SANDBOX_LEVEL` explicitly in those environments.

**Claude** workers now auto-detect permission level (no longer default to `--dangerously-skip-permissions`):
- `Bash(*) + Write(*)` → `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`
- `Write(*)` or `Edit(*)` → `--permission-mode acceptEdits`
- Otherwise → `--permission-mode default`

**Gemini** approval mode follows the same detection logic, mapped to Gemini modes:
- `Bash(*) + Write(*)` → `--approval-mode yolo`
- `Write(*)` or `Edit(*)` only → `--approval-mode auto_edit`
- Otherwise → no flag (Gemini default interactive mode)

Override via `.ao/autonomy.json`:
```json
{
  "codex": { "approval": "full-auto", "hostSandbox": "auto" },
  "gemini": { "approval": "yolo" },
  "nativeTeams": true,
  "planExecution": "ask"
}
```
Codex values: `auto` (default), `suggest`, `auto-edit`, `full-auto`
Codex host sandbox: `auto` (default — detect), `unrestricted`, `workspace-write`, `read-only`. Env var `AO_HOST_SANDBOX_LEVEL` (same enum, minus `auto`) takes precedence.
Gemini values: `auto` (default), `default`, `auto_edit`, `yolo`, `plan`
`nativeTeams`: `true` enables Native Agent Teams without env var (fallback when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` is not set in hook environment)
`planExecution`: `ask` (default) presents Solo/Atlas/Athena choice via `AskUserQuestion` interactive UI after plan approval (text fallback for non-Desktop environments); `solo` skips orchestration; `atlas`/`athena` auto-routes. Simple plans (S-scale or ≤2 stories) auto-skip to solo.

### Session Naming
- tmux sessions: `atlas-codex-<N>`, `atlas-gemini-<N>`, `athena-<slug>-codex-<N>`, `athena-<slug>-gemini-<N>`
- Cross-validation: `atlas-codex-xval-<story-id>`, `atlas-gemini-xval-<story-id>`, `athena-<slug>-codex-xval-<story-id>`, `athena-<slug>-gemini-xval-<story-id>`

### Multi-Model Auto-Routing
Atlas/Athena automatically detect available capabilities via `runPreflight()` and pass them to Metis:
- Metis receives `Available capabilities: Codex: AVAILABLE/NOT AVAILABLE, Gemini: ...`
- Team design and `MULTI_MODEL` classification are capability-aware — no phantom worker assignment
- Cross-validation priority: Codex → Gemini fallback → skip with explicit record
- Trivial tasks automatically use Claude-only (no external model overhead)

### Credential Resolution (Gemini)

Gemini workers resolve `GEMINI_API_KEY` at spawn time via
`scripts/lib/gemini-credential.mjs`. Users who already ran `gemini /auth`
(which stores the key in the OS secret store) do **not** need to also
export the key into their shell — Agent Olympus fetches it per-spawn and
injects into the child process env. The parent `process.env` is never
mutated.

**Resolution priority** (first hit wins):

1. `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY` — if set (non-empty), used verbatim. An
   explicitly empty value (`GEMINI_API_KEY=""`) is treated as "disable"
   and **skips** the keychain fallback, respecting user intent.
2. **macOS Keychain** — `security find-generic-password -s gemini-cli-api-key -a <account> -w`
3. **Linux libsecret** — `secret-tool lookup service gemini-cli-api-key account <account>`
   (tries `/usr/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, NixOS paths, then `PATH`)
4. `null` — spawn proceeds without the env var, letting the gemini CLI
   produce its own auth error if the user has no other credential source

**Caching**: Per-account `Map<'${platform}:${account}', ...>` with 5-minute
TTL. Null results are cached too (avoids re-hammering the keychain on
every spawn when no key is stored). On `auth_failed` category from the
exec/acp error classifiers, the cache entry for that account is
invalidated so the next spawn re-reads the secret store — supports
`/auth` recovery within a single session.

**Spawn paths covered**:
- `scripts/lib/gemini-exec.mjs` — single-turn `gemini --output-format json -p`
- `scripts/lib/gemini-acp.mjs` — multi-turn ACP JSON-RPC via `gemini --acp`
  (invalidates cache on 401/403 from every early-return path:
  initializeServer / createSession / loadSession / sendPrompt)
- `scripts/ask.mjs` — `/ask gemini` quick-query
- `scripts/lib/worker-spawn.mjs` — Atlas/Athena team workers
- `scripts/lib/tmux-session.mjs` — tmux fallback (via `new-session -e KEY=VAL`
  so the key never enters `send-keys` input or `capture-pane` output)

**Config** (`.ao/autonomy.json`):
```json
{
  "gemini": {
    "useKeychain": true,
    "keychainAccount": "default-api-key"
  }
}
```
Defaults are `useKeychain: true` + `keychainAccount: 'default-api-key'`
(matches the gemini CLI's own default account). Set `useKeychain: false`
to disable the resolver entirely (env-only fallback). `keychainAccount`
accepts any non-empty string including characters like `:`, `@`, `.`
since `execFile` argv prevents shell injection.

**Logging & security**:
- Raw keys are never logged. Diagnostic events emit as single-line JSON on
  stderr with masked keys: `{"event":"gemini_credential_cache_invalidated","account":"...","reason":"auth_failed"}`
- `AO_DEBUG_GEMINI=1` env var enables a `gemini-exec/acp: GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza****xx` line per spawn (mask only)
- tmux error messages are redacted via regex — any `*_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`,
  `*_SECRET`, `*_PASSWORD` values in argv echoes are replaced with
  `<redacted>` before reaching state files.

### Gemini Team Communication
Unlike Codex app-server (which supports `steerTurn()` for mid-turn injection), Gemini ACP only accepts new prompts between turns. Team communication uses a message queue pattern:
- `enqueueMessage(handle, message, { from, priority })` — queues messages during active turns
- Messages auto-drain as sequential turns when current turn completes
- Failed messages retry once, then move to dead letters (`handle._deadLetters`)
- Queue capped at `MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH=200` to prevent memory leaks

## Known Limitations

- **`--bare` mode**: When Claude Code is run with the `--bare` flag, all hooks, plugins, and skill directory walks are skipped. Agent Olympus hooks will not fire in this mode. This flag is intended for scripted `-p` calls and requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `apiKeyHelper`.
- **Sandbox mode**: Hook scripts should be tested with Claude Code's sandbox mode enabled (available on Linux and Mac). All scripts use Node.js built-ins only, so they should be compatible, but edge cases around file system access in `.ao/` may arise.
- **Gemini credential resolver — Windows**: The auto-resolver in `scripts/lib/gemini-credential.mjs` supports macOS Keychain and Linux libsecret in v1. Windows Credential Manager integration is deferred to v2. Windows users must set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in their shell/user env (one-time stderr notice is emitted on first spawn).

## Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests (1500+ tests, 69 files)
node --test 'scripts/test/**/*.test.mjs'

# Or via npm script
npm test

# Syntax check all scripts
for f in scripts/*.mjs scripts/lib/*.mjs; do node --check "$f" && echo "OK: $f"; done

# Check for stale namespace references
grep -r "oh-my-claude:" agents/ skills/ scripts/ config/   # should return nothing
grep -r "oh-my-claudecode:" skills/ agents/                 # should return nothing
grep -r '\.omc/' scripts/ skills/ agents/                   # should return nothing
```

## Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 20.0.0 (for ESM support)
- **Optional**: tmux (required for legacy worker fallback and Athena team mode)
- **Optional**: codex CLI (`npm install -g @openai/codex`) for Codex worker execution
- **Optional**: gemini CLI (`npm install -g @google/gemini-cli`) for Gemini worker execution
- **npm packages**: None (zero runtime dependencies)
