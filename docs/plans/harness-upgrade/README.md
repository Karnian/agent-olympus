# Harness Upgrade Roadmap

> Forward-looking advancement plan for Agent Olympus, produced by a 3-axis
> harness-engineering review on **2026-06-16** (baseline: `main` @ v1.1.6 +
> `feat/adapter-worker-supervisor` @ v1.2.0).

## Status & handoff — START HERE (updated 2026-06-19)

### Branch addendum — 2026-07-12

- **HU-01 implementation is now present on the current feature branch:** six
  vendored tasks, regression/capability tracks, `k=3`, pass^k/pass@k, real
  Claude result-event usage capture, baseline provenance, trend reporting, and
  a hermetic CI GREEN/RED gate. Live evals were intentionally not run; the
  committed baseline remains a declared target, so operational live-regression
  gating is not complete until a trusted operator records measured baselines.
- Live Atlas trials now require one harness-preallocated production run to
  complete the strict phase ledger, ordered events, summary finalization, and
  active-pointer cleanup before grading. This also fixed Atlas's stale-run P1:
  successful completion now calls `finalizeRun()` after the durable `complete`
  phase. The evidence is explicitly candidate-asserted, not HU-11-grade
  tamper-resistant attestation.
- **HU-06.3 is implemented on this branch:** Athena now uses the deterministic
  phase runner across all 13 phases, persists bounded spawn identity before any
  launch, adopts only provable recovery state, preserves ambiguous native/mixed
  teams, and finalizes the exact run. Athena live eval evidence now validates
  the Athena-specific phase and monitor-loop contract locally; no paid live run
  was performed.
- Live trials use fresh runtime-only plugin snapshots and bounded subprocess
  graders as defense in depth. They are not substitutes for HU-11 OS sandboxing.
- Provider-exhaustion failover now preserves root run/worktree identity and
  durable completion across Codex → Gemini → Claude. Session-global provider
  cooldown remains follow-up work; HU-19 should absorb the cross-provider
  conformance matrix.
- The next roadmap seam is **HU-17 failed-run → reviewed candidate ingestion**.
  Failed artifacts do not contain a safe, deterministic task seed/grader, so
  ingestion produces a minimal local review candidate and never auto-generates
  or commits a golden task.
- **HU-17's safe local seam is implemented:** explicit allowlisted terminal
  markers, session-linked bounded collection, metadata/digest-only candidates,
  and approve/reject/link review commands. Automatic task generation remains
  intentionally out of scope; see [HU-17-failure-ingestion.md](HU-17-failure-ingestion.md).

**Shipped on `main` (pushed, tagged):**
- **v1.2.0** — detached worker supervisor.
- **v1.2.1** — HU-02b Tier-1 read-only tool-scoping (`explore`, `architect`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `momus`) + **HU-18** contract linter.
- **v1.2.2** — read-only tiers generalized: **Tier-2** `aphrodite` (read-only + Claude Preview MCP), **Tier-3** `themis` (no-direct-edit verify, `Bash` allowed). All 7 read-only-family agents are contract- AND runtime-verified (fresh `claude -p` probe).
- **v1.2.3** — **HU-06.1** deterministic phase runner (`scripts/lib/phase-runner.mjs` + the `pipeline.json` per-run ledger; absorbs `loop-guard` as its sole caller) + **HU-06.2** Atlas `SKILL.md` rewritten onto the runner + `phase-contract.test.mjs` (15-assertion contract linter). Plan converged through 3 Codex rounds; library Codex-implemented/Claude-reviewed; Atlas rewrite Claude-implemented/Codex-reviewed ×2. Suite 2289/2289. ⚠️ runtime `claude -p` smoke deferred (Atlas would run unsupervised). **Remaining HU-06:** `.3` (Athena rewrite, incl. the `recover` branches).

**Historical 2026-06-19 snapshot (HU-01 and HU-06.3 superseded by the addendum above):** the rest of the backlog was not started (HU-01, HU-02a, HU-03–05, HU-07–20) + the **4 deferred agents** (`metis`, `prometheus`, `hermes`, `ask` — decide read-only/Bash/unrestricted per their bodies). HU-06 `.1`/`.2` shipped in v1.2.3 and `.4` documentation shipped there; `.3` is implemented on this branch.

**Absorbed into v1.2.3 (was "partial / unmerged"):**
- **`loop-guard`** (`scripts/lib/loop-guard.mjs`) — the iteration / same-error-3× / review-round caps. The **phase runner is its sole caller** — the structural chokepoint that guarantees the consult — so both Atlas and Athena reach caps through `beginAttempt`/`reattempt`/`loopTick`/`recordPhaseError`. ⚠️ Still a cooperative guardrail, not a hard safety boundary: **time / token / spend caps + a user-visible kill-switch remain unimplemented (HU-21)**.

**Recommended next:**
- **A — adversarially close HU-06.3:** keep the Athena recovery/evidence contracts under focused review, then run the full local suite. Paid live validation remains an explicit operator action.
- **B — operationalize HU-01:** run the first reviewed private/operator Atlas eval and refresh declared-target baselines with measured provenance. Public CI remains hermetic and must not perform this step.
- **C — exercise the feedback loop:** review real HU-17 candidates and manually author deterministic golden tasks for the valuable failures.
- **D — small:** tier the 4 deferred agents (`metis`, `prometheus`, `hermes`, `ask`).

**Workflow conventions (author's preferred flow):**
1. Claude writes a plan (doc in this dir). 2. **Codex cross-reviews** the plan (`codex -a never -s read-only -c model_reasoning_effort=high exec`) → GO / GO-WITH-CHANGES / NO-GO → fold into a rev-2 plan. 3. **Codex implements** (`-s workspace-write`), does NOT commit. 4. **Claude reviews** the diff + runs tests (+ a real-file mutation test for linter changes). 5. Parallelize (Athena / parallel Codex) only when sub-tasks don't share a file; a single shared artifact → one cohesive flow.

**Release procedure:** branch off `main`, FF-merge back. Bump version in **4 strings** (`package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` ×2) + prepend a CHANGELOG entry. Gate order: 4-count recheck → `claude plugin validate .` → full suite → `git fetch` + verify `main == origin/main` → FF-merge → annotated tag `vX.Y.Z` → push `main` THEN the tag. User then runs `claude plugin marketplace update` + `claude plugin update` + restart.

**Gotchas:**
- **Subagent defs load at session START** — a plugin update mid-session does NOT reload them; runtime tool restrictions only apply in a session started *after* the update. Verify with a **fresh `claude -p`** (the running session is stale).
- A Stop hook **auto-commits uncommitted work as `ao-wip`** — after Codex implements, `git reset --mixed <last-clean>` and re-commit cleanly.
- `tools:` allowlist is the enforced mechanism (NOT `disallowedTools`); MCP tokens (`mcp__server__tool`) are accepted but only inject when the MCP server is connected (graceful code-only fallback otherwise).
- Restore files via a **backup copy**, not `git checkout` (Codex's edits are uncommitted; checkout would revert them).

## Provenance (how this was produced)

| Axis | Method | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| Trend gap-analysis | 21-agent workflow: web research → adversarial verification → per-dimension gap, with cited primary sources | 7-dimension verdicts + backlog |
| External cross-review | Gemini 2.x independent review (read CLAUDE.md + select `scripts/lib`) | 7-dimension verdicts + backlog |
| Code verification | Direct grep/read of this repo | every P0–P1 claim below confirmed against source |
| Codex (gpt-5.5) | First pass hit the account limit; **constrained cross-review delivered 2026-06-17** (49k tokens, reasoning=high) critiquing this roadmap | resolved the split verdicts (3/5/7) + the reprioritization below |

**Code-verified facts** (not hallucinated — checked on `main`):
- `hooks/hooks.json` registers 9 events; **no `PreCompact`**.
- **0 of 19** `agents/*.md` declare `tools`/`disallowedTools` — read-only intent is prose only.
- `scripts/subagent-stop.mjs:49` → `lastMessage.slice(0, 4000)` (raw byte truncation, not distillation).
- `evals/` directory **absent**; 0 OpenTelemetry refs in `scripts/lib`; 0 `pass@k` refs.
- `scripts/lib/model-usage.mjs` records `inputCharLength`/`outputCharLength` — **character proxies, not real tokens** (per its own header comment).
- **Version hygiene is NOT a defect** (see HU-07): `main` is internally consistent at 1.1.6, the feature branch at 1.2.0. The reviewer's "drift" finding was a cross-branch artifact.

## Validity verdict (per dimension)

| # | Dimension | Web | Gemini | Codex | Net (majority) | One-line |
|---|-----------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|----------|
| 1 | Context engineering | on-par | on-par | on-par | 🟡 on-par | strong JIT retrieval + structured notes; **passive on compaction** |
| 2 | Memory / learning | behind | behind | behind | 🟠 behind | flat JSONL + lexical Jaccard; no consolidation/supersession/semantic |
| 3 | Orchestration & control | behind | ahead | **behind** | 🟠 behind | Codex broke the tie → prose phases + snapshot, no deterministic/durable engine |
| 4 | Claude Code native | on-par | on-par | on-par | 🟡 on-par | excellent hook usage; hand-rolls primitives the SDK now ships |
| 5 | Multi-model / coding tools | on-par | ahead | **on-par** | 🟡 on-par | "well-made multi-provider wrapper" — no best-of-N/selection/cloud/conformance |
| 6 | **Eval / observability** | behind | missing | behind | 🔴 worst gap | **zero** measurement of orchestration quality (unanimous) |
| 7 | Reliability & safety | on-par | ahead | **behind** | 🟠 behind | Codex most critical → no injection defense / unsandboxed workers / no idempotency |

> **3-model resolution:** Codex sided against Gemini on all three contested dimensions (3, 5, 7), tilting each to the more-critical verdict. Gemini's three "ahead" calls are outvoted 2:1 — **no dimension is "ahead" by majority; the strongest are on-par.** Olympus's implementation is genuinely strong, but it does not lead the frontier on any dimension.

### Synthesis thesis — *"ahead on craft, behind on paradigm"*

Every disagreement (3, 5, 7) shares one shape: **Gemini scores implementation
sophistication** (supervisor, adapters, permission union are genuinely best-in-class
→ *ahead*) while **the web-grounded axis scores adoption of 2026 frontier paradigms**
(durable execution, eval harnesses, injection defense, best-of-N → *behind*). Both
are correct. Olympus is frontier-grade at *implementing its chosen primitives* and
lagging at *adopting newer paradigms*. The upgrade direction follows directly: not
"build it better" but **"import the new paradigms, and cede to native what the
platform has absorbed."**

> Codex endorsed this thesis as the roadmap's strongest call — with one calibration:
> "craft" should read as *strong implementation*, **not** a frontier lead. Per the
> 3-model majority, no dimension is "ahead"; the supervisor/adapters/permission union
> are best-in-class *implementations of on-par/behind paradigms*.

## Prioritized backlog

Legend — 🔵 both reviewers · 🟣 Gemini · 🟢 web-verified · ⬇️ native-obsolescence risk (custom code the platform may replace)

### 🔴 P0 — foundational (trust under autonomy)

| ID | Item | Effort | Evidence / rationale |
|----|------|:--:|------|
| **HU-01** 🔵 | **Agent eval + CI regression harness** (`evals/`) — see [eval-harness-spec.md](eval-harness-spec.md) | L | `evals/` absent; 79 tests are plumbing-only. A one-line prompt/agent edit can degrade orchestration quality **undetectably**. Anthropic two-track (capability + regression) model. |
| **HU-02** 🔵🟢 | **Autonomous-worker safety gate** — (a) lethal-trifecta / Agents-Rule-of-Two gate before worker spawn; (b) promote per-agent read-only intent to SDK-enforced `disallowedTools` | M (b=S) | No live prompt-injection defense for external-model workers; `disallowedTools` is **0/19**. Read-only/review agents to constrain: **explore, architect, code-reviewer, security-reviewer, aphrodite** (⚠️ Codex: **NOT `debugger`** — its role includes *fixing*; disallowing Edit/Write would break it). |

> **⚠️ Codex re-sequencing (adopted) — close the measured boundary before building the measuring device.**
> A prose-defined orchestrator cannot be reliably eval'd: `claude -p "/atlas …"` measures
> "how well Claude followed that prose today," not the Olympus state machine. So the P0 bundle
> is too big; split it and pull the cheap safety win forward:
> - **P0a** = HU-02b reduced: enforce `disallowedTools` on read-only/review agents + a schema linter (cheap, immediate).
> - **P0b** = HU-01 **MVP only**: Atlas-only, 3 regression tasks, `k=1`, manual run. (pass^k / CI gate / baseline trend are **not** P0.)
> - **P0c** = HU-02a reduced: lethal-trifecta gate + env denylist on external-content / external-model worker spawn.
> - **HU-06 is the eval prerequisite, promote toward P1-first:** code-ify a minimal Atlas/Athena phase entrypoint so HU-01 reproduces real orchestration, not prose-following.

### 🟠 P1 — short-term (measure · durability · memory)

| ID | Item | Effort | Evidence / rationale |
|----|------|:--:|------|
| **HU-03** 🟢⬇️ | Real token-usage telemetry — replace char-length proxy + 4000/2000 constant with adapter `usage` events | M | `model-usage.mjs` logs chars; `cost-estimate.mjs` is a flat guess. Adapters already receive real usage. Foundation for cost caps + eval cost. |
| **HU-04** 🟢 | `PreCompact` hook — flush durable state + re-assert a survival summary at the compaction boundary | M | Compaction is a named top-3 context technique; Olympus is the only place fully passive. wisdom/checkpoint/prd state can be silently dropped. |
| **HU-05** 🔵 | Memory consolidation + supersession — sleep-time merge pass + `supersededBy` + freshness penalty | M / S | `pruneWisdom` only does TTL+FIFO+Jaccard-dedup; corrected facts never demote stale ones (the "change-as-replacement" staleness problem). |
| **HU-06** 🟢⬇️ | Deterministic `pipeline mode` + idempotent durable resume — code-defined phase runner + per-stage completion records | L | Orchestration is prose phases; caps (15-iter, 3-review) are advisory. checkpoints are snapshots, not replay-to-completion with exactly-once. **Update: `loop-guard` (unmerged) now code-backs those caps cooperatively — reuse it as the runner's loop-limit primitive; HU-06 supplies the missing enforcement (the runner *is* the chokepoint that guarantees the call).** |
| **HU-07** 🟢 | ~~Manifest version hygiene~~ — **VERIFIED NON-ISSUE** | — | `main`=1.1.6 and feature=1.2.0 are each internally consistent. Do **not** bump `main`'s manifests (would create real drift: version without supervisor code). Real action = merge `feat/adapter-worker-supervisor` → `main`. |

### 🟡 P2 — frontier alignment

| ID | Item | Effort | Native risk |
|----|------|:--:|:--:|
| **HU-08** 🔵 | Adopt native memory tool + context-editing (`context-management-2025-06-27`) behind a capability flag (Anthropic: +39% eval / −84% tokens) | L | ⬇️ |
| **HU-09** 🟢 | Emit OpenTelemetry GenAI spans alongside `events.jsonl` (export to Langfuse/Braintrust/LangSmith) | L | ⬇️ |
| **HU-10** 🟢 | best-of-N generate-and-select across N models in parallel worktrees (promote cross-validation from verify-only) | M | — |
| **HU-11** 🟢 | Sandbox detached workers + strip env credentials (native `/sandbox` + `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime`) | L | ⬇️ |
| **HU-12** 🟢 | Distilled sub-agent return contract (1–2K-token summary) replacing the 4000-char raw slice | S | — |
| **HU-13** 🟢 | Calibrated LLM-judge for Themis/cross-val — human gold set + isolated-per-rubric + `Unknown` escape | M | — |

### 🟢 P3 — strategic / optional

| ID | Item | Effort | Native risk |
|----|------|:--:|:--:|
| **HU-14** | Per-subagent memory scoping (align with native per-subagent `MEMORY.md`) | M | ⬇️ |
| **HU-15** | "Delegate and close the laptop" via native `RemoteTrigger`/`CronCreate` (thin skill vs custom fleet) | S | ⬇️ |
| **HU-16** | Semantic/structured wisdom retrieval pilot (local embed index) — respect zero-dep constraint, keep optional | L | — |
| **HU-17** | Hierarchical `AGENTS.md` deeper-file-wins semantics + eval-to-guardrail loop (failed runs → golden tasks) | S/M | — |

### ➕ Codex-added items (2026-06-17 cross-review)

| ID | Item | Priority | Rationale |
|----|------|:--:|------|
| **HU-18** | Agent-definition **contract linter** in CI — frontmatter schema + role→`allowedTools`/`disallowedTools` matrix + read-only-agent enforcement | P0/P1 | Makes HU-02b durable: stops a future agent edit from silently re-opening the read-only hole. Pairs with HU-02b. |
| **HU-19** | **Adapter conformance suite** — per-provider parity tests: usage events, cancellation, timeout, sandbox mode, env scrubbing, error schema | P1 | The 3 adapters (codex/claude/gemini) are not tested for behavioral parity; divergence is invisible today. |
| **HU-20** | **Threat-model doc** — trust boundaries for untrusted web/docs, model output, worker filesystem, env secrets, git ops | P1 | Should precede HU-02a — you can't gate injection without naming the boundaries. |
| **HU-21** 🟡 *partial* | **Autonomous budget / kill-switch** — enforce time / token / spend / iteration caps as user-visible policy | P1 | ~~Caps today are advisory prose~~ → **iteration / same-error / review-round caps now code-backed by `loop-guard`** (cooperative, unmerged, fail-open). **STILL OPEN** (the actual HU-21): runner/chokepoint-*enforced* consult via HU-06, time / token / spend caps (needs HU-03 real telemetry), and a user-visible kill-switch. Not the next priority — Codex 2026-06-18: finishing this now is recency bias over the #1 eval gap. |
| **HU-17→P1** | Promote **eval-to-guardrail loop** from P3 to **P1** | P1 | 3 human-authored fixtures rot fast; routing failed prod runs into the golden set is what keeps the suite alive. |

## Native-obsolescence map (⬇️ strategy)

> ⚠️ **Codex caveat:** the native equivalents below are asserted from platform **docs**
> (training + web), **not verified against this repo or the installed CLI version**. Treat
> them as *capability-flag experiments to validate*, not settled roadmap foundations.

| Custom mechanism | Native equivalent (2026) | Recommended stance |
|------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| `memory.mjs` / `wisdom.jsonl` | memory tool + context-editing beta | **Adopt** native plumbing; keep AO relevance-scoring as the *curation* layer |
| `checkpoint.mjs` | native `/rewind` | **Delegate** conversation/code rewind; re-position Stop-hook WIP for the bash side-effects `/rewind` misses |
| `model-router.mjs` / `model-routing.jsonc` | SDK-enforced per-agent `model` | **Drop** Claude-only routing; keep the Codex/Gemini multi-model layer (its real value) |
| `host-sandbox-detect.mjs` | `/sandbox` + `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` | **Use native** as the execution backend |
| persona prose tool limits | `AgentDefinition.disallowedTools` | **Adopt now** (HU-02b, cheap) |
| `permission-detect.mjs` | (future) native subagent permission propagation | **Monitor** — highest-complexity module, shrink candidate |
| worker adapters | MCP / native external-model support | **Monitor** — still the core differentiator today |

## Biggest single risk & opportunity

**🔴 Risk — "heuristic surface growing under un-measured autonomy."**
Increasingly autonomous multi-model workers run with **no eval to detect quality
regression** (HU-01) and **no injection defense** (HU-02), while a large hand-rolled
heuristic surface (wisdom/intent/permission = thousands of lines of regex + rules,
independently flagged by Gemini as *"Heuristic Overload"*) is being absorbed by the
platform. The compounding danger: maintenance cost rises while the ability to verify
the system still works does not.

**🟢 Opportunity — "Durable Background Orchestrator" as the product identity.**
The v1.2.0 detached supervisor is the **one asset both reviewers call genuinely
ahead**. Leaning into "an orchestrator that survives the session and runs in the
background" — backed by durable-execution idempotency (HU-06) and eval (HU-01) to
make autonomy *trustworthy* — is the path from "a plugin" to "an agent runtime."

## Confidence guide (where the reviewers disagree)

| Dimension | Reconciliation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Orchestration (3) | Ahead on the supervisor *mechanism*; behind on durable-execution *semantics* + deterministic control. |
| Multi-model (5) | Ahead on adapter *engineering*; on-par/behind on best-of-N + the background-cloud category. |
| Reliability (7) | Ahead on permission *detection*; behind on injection defense + worker sandboxing + idempotency. |

High-confidence (both axes agree): **Eval/observability is the #1 gap**, **Memory is behind**, **Context & Native are on-par**.
