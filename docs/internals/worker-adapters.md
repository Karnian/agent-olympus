# Detached Worker Supervisor (v1.2.0+)
> Moved verbatim from CLAUDE.md (Codex Interop v1, Ship order 1).

### Detached Worker Supervisor (v1.2.0+)

**Problem.** Atlas/Athena orchestration is **fresh-process-per-poll**: `monitorTeam` / `collectResults` / `shutdownTeam` each `loadTeamState()` from disk in a brand-new Node process. A live in-process adapter handle (`_liveHandle`) does NOT survive that boundary — `saveTeamState` strips it (`NON_SERIALIZABLE_WORKER_KEYS`). Before v1.2.0 the five non-tmux adapters spawned in-process, so once the orchestrator re-polled in a fresh process their completion was invisible and the workers were stuck `status: 'running'` forever (a fresh `monitorTeam` had no handle to read).

**Fix (the "FLIP").** `spawnTeam` no longer spawns adapters in-process. For every non-tmux worker it launches a **detached supervisor** — `node scripts/lib/adapter-worker-supervisor.mjs <manifest>` (`detached: true`, `unref`, `stdio: 'ignore'`) — that loads the adapter ITSELF, runs one prompt to terminal completion, and writes **atomic disk snapshots + a durable output file**. A fresh-process orchestrator then reads the worker's outcome from disk. tmux workers are unchanged (still `capturePane`-classified).

- **Run identity** — `allocateTeamRunId()` lets Athena mint the random 16-hex generation before launch, persist it in both the pipeline ledger and checkpoint, and pass it through `spawnTeam(..., { runId })`. Callers that omit the option retain the old behavior: `spawnTeam` allocates the generation internally. The exact ID is stamped into team state together with absolute `projectRoot`; each worker gets a `workerRunId`, and the persisted `_handle = { supervisorPid, supervisorStartId, runId, workerRunId }` is fully serializable. Athena adoption proofs, monitor completion evidence, and runtime team state must all match that preallocated generation, so a same-slug prior team cannot be adopted. The supervisor's snapshot/output/manifest paths are DERIVED from the absolute `projectRoot` + these validated hex IDs (the manifest is NOT consulted for any explicit module/snapshot/output path), so a STALE supervisor from a prior same-name run can never be read as the current one.
- **Snapshot lifecycle** (`scripts/lib/supervisor-state.mjs`, schemaVersion:1) — atomic `writeSnapshot` (0600, clamped output tail), `readSnapshot(path, expected)` with a 5-way result (`missing` / `corrupt` / `unsupported` / `mismatch` / `ok`), heartbeat freshness (future-skew bounded), HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL 10s / STALE 90s / STARTUP_GRACE 10s.
- **Readers** (`worker-spawn.mjs`) — `monitorSupervisorWorker` maps a snapshot → MonitorResult: terminal status wins; `running` + dead supervisor (PID start-time identity mismatch) → crash; `running` + stale heartbeat → crash on the 2nd consecutive poll (`_supStaleSeen` latch); missing snapshot past startup grace (or a future `startedAt`) → crash; `mismatch`/`corrupt` → invalid. `collectResults` reads the durable output file (under `.ao/artifacts/team/`). `shutdownSupervisorWorker` is **supervisor-first**: signal the supervisor group (its SIGTERM handler shuts the adapter down) → re-read the snapshot → reap a surviving adapter group via the F3 start-id-checked kill → scrub the prompt-bearing manifest.
- **Adapter dispatch** — the supervisor's `run*` functions use pure manifest→option builders in `scripts/lib/supervisor-opts.mjs` (`buildExecOpts` / `buildAppserverThreadOpts` / `buildGeminiAcpSessionOpts`), kept in a CLI-free module so the wiring is unit-testable without importing the supervisor (which runs `main()` on import). gemini `model` rides on `createSession` (→ `unstable_setSessionModel`), NOT `startServer`.
- **Manifest hygiene** — the manifest carries the raw prompt. It is DATA for behavior (and supplies `projectRoot`/`cwd`), but NO explicit module/snapshot/output path is ever read from it — those are derived from the absolute `projectRoot` + validated IDs. The supervisor truncates+unlinks it on startup; a launch failure or an early shutdown also truncates+unlinks it so the prompt never lingers to the 24h sweep.
- **SessionEnd** — `session-end.mjs` sweeps the supervisor tree **per-run** (never wholesale) and skips a run with a `running` snapshot that has a fresh heartbeat OR a live supervisor PID (identity-checked when a `supervisorStartId` is recorded and readable; otherwise it fails open to a bare `kill(pid,0)` existence probe).
- **Security** — the built-in `fixture` adapter (test-only) is selectable ONLY when `AO_SUPERVISOR_ALLOW_FIXTURE==='1'`, which `spawnTeam` STRIPS from the child env in production; tests opt in via `_inject.supervisor.env`.

Key files: `scripts/lib/adapter-worker-supervisor.mjs` (detached CLI), `scripts/lib/supervisor-state.mjs` (paths + atomic snapshot I/O), `scripts/lib/supervisor-opts.mjs` (pure option builders), `scripts/lib/proc-identity.mjs` (`readProcStartId` PID start-time identity for reuse detection). See `docs/plans/adapter-worker-supervisor/PLAN.md`.

### Provider-exhaustion failover

`worker-spawn.mjs` owns one bounded replacement chain for external workers.
Provider exhaustion (quota/rate-limit or repeated network/timeout failure)
moves Codex to Gemini when available; Gemini receives its own fresh unavailable
retry budget before the chain terminates at a native Claude Task handoff. A
generic crash retries that provider once and then demotes to Claude rather than
pretending the provider is exhausted. Authentication and missing-binary failures
skip inappropriate manual retries. Atlas creates external workers through one
canonical `spawnTeam(teamSlug, workers, cwd, capabilities)` call. Athena
preallocates and durably records its generation, calls
`spawnTeam(teamSlug, workers, cwd, capabilities, { runId })`, and requires that
exact identity for adoption, monitor evidence, `collectResults`, and cleanup.

Every transition preserves the root `{teamName, workerName, runId,
workerRunId, prompt}` identity. A pre-launch attempt id covers adapter/tmux
startup failures; an incomplete legacy identity fails closed instead of reusing
another run's output. Provider child-team creation is serialized by an
owner-record lock (`0600`, PID + process start identity). The fully written
owner intent is published with a same-directory no-replace hard link, so no
empty owner path is visible; malformed legacy locks fail closed. Dead-owner recovery is
bound to the exact observed lock generation by a permanent, create-exclusive
recovery claim before that generation can be removed. The takeover fence uses
the same one-winner rule. Re-reading the generation after the claim prevents a
stale observer from deleting a replacement owner, while the permanent claim
prevents a third contender from replaying recovery for the same dead owner.
Provider recovery claims are durable and excluded from SessionEnd's transient
state sweep. Deterministic child team names make repeated polls idempotent.

Replacement workers inherit the root worker's `cwd`/`worktreePath` and branch,
but set `worktreeCreated:false`. A child team therefore operates on the same
task state without claiming or deleting the root Athena worktree. tmux fallback
uses the inherited directory directly; supervisor adapters receive it in their
manifest.

Terminal replacement output is written atomically under
`.ao/artifacts/provider-fallback/<handoffId>.json`, paired with
`.ao/state/provider-fallback-<handoffId>.json` (`schemaVersion:1`, mode `0600`).
`monitorTeam` overlays that durable completion onto the failed root worker and
`collectResults` treats it as canonical, so resume or child-team cleanup cannot
re-run an already completed task. `SessionEnd` sweeps inactive completion
artifacts after 24 hours. A native Claude fallback claim is not reclaimed merely
because its lease timestamp elapsed: elapsed time cannot prove that the Task is
dead, and a second claim could duplicate work in the same worktree. Recovery
therefore requires authenticated terminal output or explicit external proof.
The chain is per worker; a session-global provider circuit breaker/cooldown
remains a separate follow-up.


### Adapter Priority (highest → lowest)

**Codex workers** (`type: 'codex'`):
1. **codex-appserver** — Multi-turn JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (`codex app-server`)
   - Thread/turn lifecycle, live steering via `steerTurn()`, structured errors
   - Requires `hasCodexAppServer` capability (codex ≥ 0.116.0 + app-server subcommand)
2. **codex-exec** — Single-turn JSONL via `child_process.spawn` (`codex exec --json`)
   - 5 event types, error classification, group-targeted SIGTERM→SIGKILL shutdown
   - `collect()` reaps lingering tool-call descendants that inherited codex's stdout pipe: on the direct child's `'exit'`, if stdout is still open it SIGTERMs the process group, so a held-open pipe can't delay completion or leave a spurious "failed" background shell (#74)
   - Requires `hasCodexExecJson` capability (codex ≥ 0.116.0)

**Claude workers** (`type: 'claude'`):
3. **claude-cli** — Headless Claude Code via `claude -p --output-format stream-json`
   - Stream-json JSONL (system/assistant/result events), budget control, model override
   - Binary auto-discovered from versioned install paths (macOS/Linux)
   - Requires `hasClaudeCli` capability

**Gemini workers** (`type: 'gemini'`):
4. **gemini-acp** — Multi-turn JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (`gemini --acp`)
   - ACP (Agent Communication Protocol): newSession/prompt/cancel/setSessionMode lifecycle
   - camelCase method names (sessionStarted, promptCompleted, etc.)
   - Message queue for team communication: `enqueueMessage()` → auto-drain on turn completion
   - No mid-turn injection (unlike Codex `steerTurn()`) — messages queued between turns
   - Requires `hasGeminiAcp` capability (gemini CLI with `--acp` flag support)
5. **gemini-exec** — Single-turn JSON via `child_process.spawn` (`gemini --output-format json -p`)
   - Single JSON object output, error classification, SIGTERM→SIGKILL shutdown
   - Requires `hasGeminiCli` capability

Both Gemini adapters resolve their executable through `scripts/lib/gemini-binary.mjs` without adding a new adapter or changing `ADAPTER_REGISTRY`: `AO_GEMINI_BINARY` verbatim override first, then a real resolved `gemini` path, then a real resolved `agy` path. If neither binary is found, the adapters still spawn bare `gemini` so the existing ENOENT/not_installed flow remains intact, but the error message also explains the 2026-06-18 Gemini CLI tier split and the override.

Detached supervisor snapshots may include `workerMeta.binaryFlavor` (`gemini`, `agy`, or `custom`) and `workerMeta.binaryResolved` from the live adapter handle. Baseline: validated e2e against gemini-cli 0.50.0 (exec JSON roundtrip + ACP initialize; ACP `protocolVersion` is numeric as of 0.50 — 0.37.x has not been re-validated since that change). agy path unit-tested only (no binary available), e2e pending. Preflight capability detection and the tmux gemini command also route through `resolveGeminiBinary()`, so an agy-only install or `AO_GEMINI_BINARY` override still selects the Gemini adapters.

**All workers**:
6. **tmux** — Legacy fallback, works for all worker types
   - `tmux new-session` + `tmux send-keys` + `tmux capture-pane`
   - Always available when tmux is installed


### Session Naming
- tmux sessions: `atlas-codex-<N>`, `atlas-gemini-<N>`, `athena-<slug>-codex-<N>`, `athena-<slug>-gemini-<N>`
- Cross-validation: `atlas-codex-xval-<story-id>`, `atlas-gemini-xval-<story-id>`, `athena-<slug>-codex-xval-<story-id>`, `athena-<slug>-gemini-xval-<story-id>`
